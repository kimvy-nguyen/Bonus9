        <h3>
            Advocacy
        </h3>
        <p> My life experiences have led me to identifying my advocacy as a major part of my identity.
            I was born and raised with the ideology that if I recognize a wrongdoing, neutrality is not an option. I've had opportunities working with The City of Grand Rapids' Our Community's Children sector, the 61st District Courthouse, and Mrs. Shannon Cohen in bettering my community. I had the honor of placing as the First Runner Up at the Miss Asia of Michigan Scholarship Pageant, while advocating for equitable opportunities for minority populations.

        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>Putting a pause on my Junior year at Grand Valley State University's Frederik Meijer Honors College while studying Product Design & Manufacturing Engineering, I've decided to explore the field of Software Development and Engineering. I'm currently enrolled in a Grand Circus After-Hours C#/.Net Coding Boot Camp and have been really enjoying my experience and the learning process so far. I dabbled in Java while taking Advanced Placement Computer Science in high school, and am thrilled to have so quickly accelerated to the level at which I am coding now. I'm looking forward to still remaining a part of the Grand Valley community as a mentor for middle-school aged girls interested in entering the STEM field. </p>
<h5>Home is Where The Mitten Is</h5>
<p>I was born and raised within the Grand Rapids Public Schools school district, where I had the amazing opportunity to attend Blandford Nature School. My experience there allowed for myself to develop a profound relationship with the world around me. For a couple years in middle school my family relocated to San Diego, CA. Although it's hard to find a flaw in having perfect weather every day, I found myself missing the leaves changing with an autumn breeze around fall, and seeing the streets coated in a blanket of white on Christmas Day. Upon my return to Michigan, my family relocated to Kentwood, MI (a suburb southeast of Grand Rapids) where I was exposed to situations I would've never experienced otherwise. I've gathered a passion for my community in Grand Rapids through my various internship experiences and am so thrilled to soon be entering the workforce as a Junior Software Developer.</p>
